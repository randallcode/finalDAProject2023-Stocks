# Data Analysis Stock Project 
This was a project designed to show the skills I learned after taking the Data Anaylsis Code Kentucky Bootcamp during the Summer & Fall of 2023. The focus of the project was to take two .cvs files regarding the S&P 500 and performing various data anaylst using Pandas and Juypter Notebook coding cells. 

The two data sets I used were sourced from Kaggle.com and are from pre-2020.   

## Features I included: 
1. **Read two data files:** I read two data files (in .csv format specifically for this project).
2. **Cleaned the data and performed a pandas merge:** I cleaned the data and then performed a pandas merge with the two datasets. Additionally, I calculated new values based on the merged dataset.
3. **Made three visualizations:** I created three visualizations to display the data using matplotlib and seaborn.
4. **Utilized a virtual environment:** I set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
