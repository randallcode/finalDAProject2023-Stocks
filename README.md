# Data Analysis Stock Project
This was a project designed to show the skills I learned after taking the Data Anaylsis Code Kentucky Bootcamp during the Summer & Fall of 2023. The focus of the project was to take two .cvs files regarding the S&P 500 and performing various data anaylst using Pandas and Juypter Notebook coding cells. 

Features I included:
    Feature 1: Read two data files (.cvs specifically for this project)
    Feature 2: Cleaned the data and then performed a pandas merge with the two datasets; calculated new values based upon the new data set
    Feature 3: Made three visualizations to display the data
    Feature 4: Utilized a virtual environment and included the instructions on how to set it up - see below.

The data sets I used were sourced from Kaggle.com and are from pre-2020.   

How to use the virtual environment (Instructions for Windows only)
1) Fork the repository: https://github.com/randallcode/finalDAProject2023-Stocks
2) Clone the repository
3) Use your preferred terminal to navigate to the repository
4) Install a virtual environment using "python -m venv venv"
5) Activate the virtual environment using "venv\Scripts\activate"
6) Install the necessary libraries by using "pip install -r requirements.txt"
7) When finished deactivate the virtual environment by using "deactivate"
